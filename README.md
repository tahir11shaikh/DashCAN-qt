🧰 DashCAN — Open Source CAN Bus Monitoring Tool(DashCAN-Overview video link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XMqV9JXD6d6TOGpGYja2csdfHu0FnINa/view?usp=drive_link)

DashCAN is an open-source Windows application for monitoring, analyzing, and visualizing CAN bus communication.
Developed in C++/Qt (Open Source), DashCAN provides a modern, flexible, and community-driven alternative to proprietary tools such as BusMaster or PCAN-Explorer, with a strong focus on real-time DBC decoding, visualization, and workspace management.

⚙️ Designed for PEAK-System PCAN-USB adapters using the PCAN-Basic API.
📜 Complies fully with Qt LGPLv3 and PEAK-System’s EULA.

🚀 Key Features
Standard DBC file attachment for real-time CAN message parsing and decoding
- 📂 Standard DBC file attachment for real-time CAN message parsing and decoding  
- 🔍 Real-time message monitor — view CAN IDs, names, and decoded signals  
- 📈 Signal plotting — visualize multiple signals over time (value-range vs. time graph)  
- 🎛️  Custom dashboard builder — create your own panels with dials, bars, numeric displays, etc., for live signal monitoring  
- 💾 Data saving — export and save messages, signals, and dashboards from graphs or live data views  
- 🧾 Trace recording — record transmit/receive traffic in **PCAN-Explorer (.trc)** format  
- ⏯️  Trace playback — load and replay recorded trace files for analysis  
- 📡 Transmission control — send one-shot or periodic CAN messages  
- 🔢 Advanced filtering — filter messages by CAN ID or by message name  
- 🔌 PCAN-USB configuration — connect to PEAK hardware, configure standard bitrates  
- 🗂️  Workspace management — organize all project-related files (DBC, logs, traces, configs) in a dedicated workspace  
- 🧹 System logs — view, save, and clear detailed logs  
- 🧾 Device status view — see connected PCAN device and bitrate information in status bar  
- ⚠️  Bus error status monitoring — observe error states and bus conditions in real-time  

🧩 Supported Hardware
DashCAN supports only genuine PEAK-System CAN hardware (e.g., PCAN-USB, PCAN-USB FD).
